Variables and expressions
To translate a real-world problem into one that can be solved by an algorithm, there are two
interrelated tasks. Firstly, select the variables, and secondly, find the expressions that relate
to these variables. Variables are labels attached to objects; they are not the object itself. They
are not containers for objects either. A variable does not contain the object, rather it acts as a
pointer or reference to an object.
